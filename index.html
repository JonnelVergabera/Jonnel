                <br>
                <p1>HCI - (Human Computer Interaction) is the study of how people interact with <br>
                    computers and to what extent computers are or are not developed for successful <br>
                    interaction with human beings.
                <br>
                Why should we learn Human Computer Interaction? <br>
                    HCI is a vital factor when developing structures that are not only<br>
                    functional but also accessible to persons with disabilities. HCI's central <br>
                    concept is to have secure, accessible and effective systems for all, including <br>
                    those with a variety of capabilities and a variety of experience and knowledge.<br> - "Dr. DÃ³nal Fitzpatrick"</p1>
